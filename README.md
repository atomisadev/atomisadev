**Hi, I'm Atom.**

Hey there. Thanks for visiting my profile. If you like a good UI, you can [visit my website](https://atomdev.cf). Actually come to think of it, it's a decent UI.

Anyways, I'm Atom. Here are a list of languages (and my skill level with it) listed below:
- C++ **- Intermediate**
- C# **- Intermediate**
- Java **- Intermediate**
- JavaScript **- Very Experienced**
- TypeScript **- Advanced**
- Go **- Intermediate**
- Rust **- Intermediate**
- HTML & CSS **- Experienced**

I work mainly with JS and TS to make web applications and software for people and developers to use. I have also made a few Steam release games which have all been archived now and made open-source through itch.io. 

🎨 **Current projects:**
- NeoPass - Advanced Password Manager
